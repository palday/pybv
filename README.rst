PyBV
============

A Python package for reading and writing the BrainVision data format.

Installation
----------------

PyBV requires a working Python interpreter (either 2.7+ or 3+).

Assuming a standard Python environment is installed on your machine (including pip), PyBV itself can be installed in one line using pip:
::

    python -m pip install --user --upgrade pybv

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package, you can install from GitLab:
::
brainvision
    python -m pip install --user --upgrade  git+https://gitlab.com/palday/pybv.git

Dependencies should be handled automatically by pip.


Development
----------------

The primary hosting for this project is on `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/palday/pybv>`_, and issues should be raised there. A `GitHub mirror <https://github.com/palday/pybv/>`_ is provided for convenience and redundancy. Pull requests can be made on either site.
